  "response": "A Sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any real value to a value between 0 and 1. It is typically used in machine learning and artificial neural networks to introduce non-linearity into the model. The most commonly used Sigmoid function is the logistic function, which is defined as \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\). The Sigmoid function is useful for tasks such as binary classification, where the output needs to be converted to a probability",
