        "response": "An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between applications and the hardware, handling tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, file management, and user interface. The OS is essential for a computer to function properly and allows users to interact with the hardware and run applications. Popular examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux.",

He is best known for his work during World War II at Bletchley Park, where he played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code, helping to shorten the war. Turing also developed the concept of the universal Turing machine, which laid the foundation for the modern theory of computation. Tragically, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality and was chem",

In Federated Learning, the model is trained locally on each device using the data available on that device, and only the model updates are shared with a central server or coordinator. This allows for privacy preservation as the raw data never leaves the local devices, and also enables collaborative model training across distributed devices.",
